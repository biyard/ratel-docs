# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory contains screenshot references for the Ratel documentation.

## Status

⚠️ **Placeholder Images Needed**

The documentation has been updated with screenshot references, but the actual screenshot image files need to be captured from the Ratel application.

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ Screenshot directory structure created
2. ✅ Comprehensive screenshot guide written (`SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md`)
3. ✅ All documentation updated with screenshot references
4. ⏳ Actual screenshots need to be captured and added

## Quick Start for Screenshots

To capture all needed screenshots:

1. Review `SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md` for specifications
2. Log into Ratel at https://dev.ratel.foundation
3. Capture screenshots following the guide
4. Save to appropriate subdirectories
5. Optimize images (<500KB each)

## Temporary Build Solution

To allow the documentation to build before screenshots are available, placeholder images have been created.

**Replace these placeholders with actual screenshots as soon as possible!**

## Screenshot Count

- Account: 11 screenshots
- Posts: 13 screenshots

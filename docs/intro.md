## What is Ratel?

Ratel provides two core capabilities:

### 1. Deliberation & Survey Spaces

Create structured environments for policy discussions, community decisions, and opinion gathering. Ratel's deliberation framework helps communities:

- **Conduct Pre-Surveys**: Capture initial opinions before discussions begin
- **Facilitate Anonymous Discussions**: Enable open dialogue through verified anonymous participation
- **Track Opinion Changes**: Measure how deliberation influences perspectives through post-surveys
- **Analyze Results**: Understand consensus building through comprehensive analytics

**Perfect for**: Policy makers, community organizers, educational institutions, and any group seeking structured decision-making.

### 2. Fine-Art (d.AGIT): Trusted Artwork Trading

**d.AGIT** (Digital Assets Guardianship & Interchange Terminal) is a peer-to-peer marketplace for mid-to-low price artworks (under 50M KRW / ~$5,000 USD) that addresses trust issues between galleries, artists, and collectors through:

- **Electronic Art Records (EAR)**: Comprehensive digital documentation of artwork provenance
- **Oracle Verification**: Multi-party authentication system for artwork authenticity
- **Blockchain Certificates**: Immutable proof of ownership and transaction history
- **Digital Art Twins**: NFT representations paired with physical artworks

**Perfect for**: Art collectors, emerging artists, galleries, and anyone participating in the affordable art market.

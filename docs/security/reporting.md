# Security Vulnerability Reporting

We appreciate the security research community's help in keeping Ratel secure.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: [security@biyard.co](mailto:security@biyard.co)
2. **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability Report"
3. **Include**:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if any)
   - Your contact information

### Our Commitment

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

## Scope

### In Scope
✅ Authentication and authorization flaws
✅ Data leakage or exposure
✅ SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities

✅ Server-side code execution

### Out of Scope

## Guidelines

**DO**:
- Provide detailed vulnerability reports
- Allow reasonable time for fixes
- Maintain confidentiality until disclosure
- Test only on your own accounts

**DON'T**:
- Access or modify other users' data
- Perform DoS/DDoS attacks
- Exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Publicly disclose before we've addressed the issue

## Recognition

We maintain a Security Researchers Hall of Fame recognizing responsible disclosure contributors.

## Bug Bounty Program

We're launching a bug bounty program in Q2 2025 with rewards up to $15,000 for critical vulnerabilities.

## Legal Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Act in good faith
- Do not violate user privacy
- Do not disrupt our services

Thank you for helping us keep Ratel secure!

# Understanding Oracle

Learn how the Oracle system enables decentralized identity verification through community voting on the Ratel platform.

## What is Oracle?

The Oracle is a multi-party verification system that uses voting to validate DID (Decentralized Identity) attributes. Unlike traditional identity systems limited to governmental attributes like KYC, the Oracle enables the expansion of user identity attributes through community-based authentication.

## DID Attribute Verification

The Oracle serves as the foundation for Ratel's DID issuer feature, allowing the community to verify and attest to various user attributes:

- **Governmental Attributes**: Traditional KYC verification
- **Professional Credentials**: Skills, certifications, work experience
- **Reputation Metrics**: Community standing, expertise domains
- **Social Proof**: Verified affiliations, memberships
- **Custom Attributes**: Any attribute the community deems valuable

## About Ratel

### One-Liner

Ratel is the world's first decentralized legislative platform bridging crypto users and policymakers through transparent, blockchain-based governance.

### Short Description (50 words)

Ratel connects policymakers, industry experts, and users to shape crypto regulations through democratic deliberation. Built on blockchain with DID verification and governance tokens, Ratel creates transparent, evidence-based policy formation while supporting digital artists through Fine-Art (d.AGIT) marketplace integration.

### Long Description (150 words)

Ratel is a revolutionary decentralized platform transforming how crypto regulations are formed. By combining blockchain technology, AI, and democratic deliberation processes, Ratel bridges the gap between disconnected stakeholders—policymakers struggling to understand crypto, industry leaders facing regulatory uncertainty, and users operating in gray areas.

The platform features multi-stage deliberation (Pre-survey → Discussion → Post-survey), Oracle-based DID verification for expertise recognition, and RATEL token governance. Users participate in evidence-based policy formation through transparent consensus building.

Beyond policy, Ratel includes Fine-Art (d.AGIT), a P2P digital art marketplace empowering creators and preserving cultural heritage through NFTs without intermediary fees.

Starting with crypto regulation, Ratel's vision extends to AI policy and other emerging technology domains, creating a blueprint for participatory governance in the digital age.

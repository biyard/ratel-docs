# Our Story

Learn about how Ratel came to be.

## The Problem

In many countries, including South Korea, crypto regulations are lagging behind while policymakers and industry stakeholders remain disconnected. Institutional participation is limited, ICOs and IEOs are banned, and startups are forced to move abroad due to unclear regulations. This has turned the crypto market into a speculative space dominated by retail investors, rather than an environment fostering sustainable innovation.

### The Disconnect

**Policymakers** struggle to understand the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, often relying on outdated frameworks designed for traditional finance.

**Industry Leaders** face uncertainty, unable to plan long-term strategies without clear regulatory guidance.

**Users** are left vulnerable, operating in a gray area where consumer protection is minimal and innovation is stifled.

**Result**: A regulatory vacuum that hinders innovation, drives talent and capital abroad, and fails to protect everyday users.

## The Solution

Ratel is the world's first decentralized legislative platform designed to bridge the gap between crypto users and policymakers. Built on blockchain and AI, Ratel ensures transparency, governance, and active community participation in shaping crypto regulations.
